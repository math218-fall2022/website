## Where to find information

- Course website: [https://math218-fall2022.github.io/website/](https://math218-fall2022.github.io/website/)

- GitHub (assignments): [https://github.com/math218-fall2022](https://github.com/math218-fall2022)

## Course Objectives

- Introduce fundamental tools for building predictive models, including some "state-of-the-art" methods in data science

- Understand the role of model assessment, comparison, and selection 

- Learn how to use the vast collection of tools in R to implement the methods learned

- Have fun!


---


## Necessary background

I assume you have taken Math 118 prior to this course, and are comfortable with R and RStudio. There is a large emphasis on computing.

This is not a theory course. We will focus more on applications and developing intuition. The goal is to develop a toolbox of methods that you may use in future analyses.

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one). After you create your account, click [here](https://forms.gle/9McLQvHGTzWoqAeM7) and enter your GitHub username.

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

## Course Policies

---

## Class Meetings 

--

<font class="vocab">Lecture</font> 
- Focus on concepts behind statistical learning techniques
- Interactive lecture that includes examples and hands-on exercises
- Bring fully-charged laptop to every lecture
    - Please let me know as soon as possible if you do not have access to a laptop

--

<font class="vocab">Lab</font>
- Typically occurs on Fridays
- Focus on computing in R
- Apply concepts from lecture to case study scenarios

---

## Textbooks

- [Introduction to Statistical Learning, 2nd Edition](https://www.statlearning.com/)
    - Free PDF available online. Hard copy available for purchase.
    - Optional supplement
  

---

## Activities & Assessments

- <font class="vocab">Homework</font>: Almost weekly individual homework assignments focused on deepening conceptual understanding of the concepts covered in lecture. In weeks with labs, homework will be assigned on Mondays after class. In weeks without lab, homework will be assigned on Friday after class. In both cases, the homework assignment is due the following Thursday at 11:59pm. Completed homework (written or typed) should be submitted as a PDF onto Canvas.  *Lowest score will be dropped.*

--

- <font class="vocab">Labs</font>: Almost weekly lab assignments focused on learning how to implement the methods learned in class in R. Labs will begin as individual assignments, but may become partnered as the semester progresses.  When assigned, labs will be started in class on Fridays, and due the following Sunday at 11:59pm. Your completed lab should be submitted as a PDF onto Canvas. *Lowest score will be dropped.*


---


## Activities & Assessments (cont.)

- <font class="vocab">Exams</font>: One take-home midterm exam, scheduled for **Monday, Oct. 17, 2022**.

--

- <font class="vocab">Final Project</font>: An opportunity to analyze a data set of your choosing using some methods learned during the semester, and/or a method that you teach yourself. There is both an oral presentation as well as a written component. Projects will be presented during the last two days of the semester on **Friday Dec. 9, 2022 and Monday, Dec. 12, 2022**. You must complete the project and present in class to pass the course. You will have the oppportunity to revise the written component up until the end of finals.

--

- <font class="vocab">Participation</font>: I expect you to attend every class! Additionally, there will be various small assignments to help deepen your learning experience (e.g. reflection exercises, peer feedback)

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 30%|
| Labs | 20% |
| Midterm Exam | 20% |
| Final Project | 25% |
| Participation | 5% |

--


- You are expected to attend all lectures. Excessive absences can impact your final course grade.


</small>

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic dean’s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp; Regrade Requests

- Homework assignments: 
    - After the assigned deadline, there is a 10% penalty for each day the assignment is late
    - Please communicate with me early if you will need a homework extension!
    
- Late work will not be accepted for the take-home exams or final project. 

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment is returned 

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Middlebury Honor code.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them! If my scheduled office hours do not work for you, feel free to send me an e-mail!

--

- **Campuswire**: An online forum for asking and answering questions. Great place to post general/clarifying questions about lecture material or assignments.


---


### Inclusion 

In this course, we will strive to create a learning environment that is welcoming to all students. If there is any aspect of the class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. 
<br><br> 

Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me and/or your academic dean.  <br><br> 

--

We will finish class today with a discussion about what we want our classroom community to look like.

## Survival Analysis

- Survival analysis concerns a special kind of outcome/response variable: the **time until an event occurs**

  - Suppose we are conducting a three-year medical study about patients who have had one heart attack
  
  - We would like to fit a model to predict the time until the second heart attack, using features such as baseline health measurement, weight, sex, etc.
  
--

- May sound like a regression problem, but important complication: survival data is often **censored**

---

## Survival and Censored data

- **Censoring** refers to a type of missing data

- Why? It is very likely that some of the patients:

  - drop out of the medical study, or
  
  - do not have a second heart attack within the three-year study window
  
--

- Does not mean the patient will never experience the event, but that the event *did not happen while under observation*

--

- Do not want to discard this subset of patients, because surviving beyond study window is still valubale information! 

---

## Another example

- A company (e.g. Netflix) wants to model *churn*, the event when customers cancel their subscription to a service (e.g. account)

- Netflix might collect data on customers over some timer period in order to predict each customer's time to cancellation

  - Presumably, not all customers will have cancelled their subscription by the end of this time period
  
  - Time to cancellation is censored for this group of customers
  
---

## Survival and Censoring Times

- For each individual, we suppose there is a true

  - **survival**/**failure**/**event** time `\(T\)`, and
  
  - **censoring** time `\(C\)`
  
- Survival time `\(T\)` represents the time at which the event of interest occurs (e.g. heart attack)

- Censoring time `\(C\)` is time at which the censoring occurs (e.g. study ends or patient drops out)

---

## What we observe

- We observe *either* the survival time `\(T\)` or the censoring time `\(C\)` (not both)

- Specifically, we observe the random variable `$$Y = \min(T,C)$$`

--

- If the event occurs before censoring, do we observe `\(T\)` or `\(C\)`?

- If the censoring occurs before event, do we observe `\(T\)` or `\(C\)`?

--

- Thus, we also observe status indicator:

`$$\delta = \begin{cases}1 &amp; \text{ if } T \leq C  \\ 
0 &amp; \text{ if } T &gt; C\end{cases}$$`

--

- In our data, we observe `\(n\)` pairs `\((y_{i}, \delta_{i}), \ldots, (y_{n}, \delta_{n})\)`

---

## Illustration

---


## Closer look

- Suppose we have data from a study on cancer treatment over a five-year window. Want to model time until death

- Many patients drop out of the study early because they are very sick

  - Our analysis should incorporate the reason why the patients dropped out early. Why?

- Suppose that males who are very sick are more likely to drop out than females who are very sick

  - Comparison of male and female survival times may wrongly suggest that males survive longer
  
--

- **Assumption**: conditional on the features `\(X\)`, the event time `\(T\)` is *independent* of the censoring time `\(C\)`

---

## Types of censoring

- Left, right, and interval

- We will focus on *right*-censoring: when `\(T \geq Y\)` (i.e. true event time is at least as large as observed time)

---


## Survival Curve

- **Survival curve** or function is defined as

`$$S(t) = \text{Pr}(T &gt; t)$$`

  - i.e. `\(S(t)\)` is the probability that we survive beyond time `\(t\)`
  
--

- `\(S(t)\)` is a decreasing function of `\(t\)`. Why?

--

- For given `\(t\)`, a larger `\(S(t)\)` implies lower probability that patient will die before time `\(t\)`

## Estimating Survival Curve

- Suppose we want to estimate `\(S(20) = \text{Pr}(T &gt; 20)\)`, the probability that a patients survives for at least 20 months. 

question[How might we do that?]

---

## Estimating Survival Curve

- Should we compute the proportion of patients who are known to have survived beyond 20 months (i.e. `\(Y &gt; 20\)`)? 


```r
n &lt;- nrow(BrainCancer)
(n_surv20 &lt;- sum(BrainCancer$time &gt; 20))
```

```
## [1] 48
```

```r
n_surv20/n
```

```
## [1] 0.5454545
```

- Issue: those with `\(y_{i} &lt; 20\)` did not necessarily die!


```r
# number of patients who dropped-out before 20 months
sum(BrainCancer$time &lt; 20 &amp; BrainCancer$status == 0)
```

```
## [1] 17
```

---

## Estimating Survival Curve (cont.)

- Instead, maybe we compute the proportion of patients for whom `\(Y&gt;20\)` among the patient who were *not* censored by time `\(t = 20\)`


```
## [1] 0.6760563
```

- Issue: ignores patients who were censored before `\(t = 20\)`

### Kaplan-Meier estimator of survival curve

&lt;img src="09-survival_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- Based on KM estimate, approximately what is `\(S(20)\)`?

  - How does this compare to our "naive" estimates?
  
---

### Stratifying

---

## Log-rank test?

---

## Regression with survival response

- Want to learn how features `\(X\)` might influence the probability of survival. 

- How to fit a regression model to survival data? 

--

- Want to predict true survival time `\(T\)`, but we only observe `\(Y = \min(T, C)\)`

- Solution: sequential construction

---

## Hazard function

- The **hazard function** is formally defined as

`$$h(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{\text{Pr}(t &lt; T \leq t + \Delta t| T &gt; t)}{\Delta t}$$`
where `\(T\)` is true survival time.

- Interpretation: death rate in the instant right after time `\(t\)`, given survival up to time `\(t\)`

--

- Implies that for arbitrarily small `\(\Delta t\)`,

`$$h(t) \approx \frac{\text{Pr}(t &lt; T \leq t + \Delta t| T &gt; t)}{\Delta t}$$`
---

## Hazard function and Survival curve

$$
\begin{align*}
h(t) &amp;= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\text{Pr}(t &lt; T \leq t + \Delta t| T &gt; t)}{\Delta t} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\text{Pr}((t &lt; T \leq t + \Delta t) \cap (T &gt; t))/\Delta t}{\text{Pr}(T &gt; t)} \\
&amp;= \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\text{Pr}(t &lt; T \leq t + \Delta t)/\Delta t}{S(t)} \\
&amp;= \frac{f(t)}{S(t)}
\end{align*} 
$$

where `\(f(t) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0}\frac{\text{Pr}(t &lt; T \leq t + \Delta t)}{\Delta t}\)` is probability density function of `\(T\)`

---

## Proportional Hazards Model

- We would like to model survival time as a function of predictors. 

- There are many ways, but we will discuss the **proportional hazards** model which assumes

`$$h(t | x_{i}) = h_{0}(t) \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_{j}\right)$$`

- `\(h_{0}(t) \geq 0\)` is the *baseline hazard*, typically unspecified function

  - Why baseline? Hazard function for individual with `\(x_{i1} = \ldots = x_{ip} = 0\)`

- Name "proportional" hazards comes from the fact that the hazard function given a set of predictors `\(x_{i}\)` is simply proportional to the baseline

  - The factor `\(\exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij} \beta_{j}\right)\)` is called the **relative risk** for feature vector `\(\mathbf{x}_{i} = (x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ip})'\)`, relative to that for `\(\mathbf{x}_{0} = (0, \ldots, 0)'\)`
  
---

## Proportional Hazards Model

- What do we mean that `\(h_{0}(t)\)` is unspecified?

  - We make no assumptions about its functional form
  
  - Allows the instantaneous probability of event (e.g. death) at time `\(t\)` to take any form (given survival to time `\(t\)`)
  
  - Extremely flexible, allowing a wide range of relationships between `\(x\)`'s and the survival time
  
--

- Our only assumption: a one-unit increase in `\(x_{ij}\)` corresponds to an increase in `\(h(t|x_{i})\)` by a *factor* of `\(e^{\beta_{j}}\)`

--

.question[Is proportional hazards model parametric or nonparametric?]

---

## Example: proportional hazards

- `\(p=1\)` where `\(x\)` is binary predictor (blue, red). Plots of `\(\log h(t)\)` and `\(S(t)\)`

&lt;img src="09-survival_files/figure-html/prop_hazard-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Example: non-proportional hazards

&lt;img src="09-survival_files/figure-html/non_prop_hazard-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Estimating coefficients

- How to estimate the `\(\beta_{j}\)`'s?

- Because `\(h_{0}(t)\)` is unknown, cannot straightforwardly estimate the `\(\beta_{j}\)`'s as usual

--

- However, we  can still estimate `\(\beta\)` *without having the specific form of* `\(h_{0}(t)\)` using the partial likelihood

---

## Partial likelihood

- Assume that the failure/event times are unique (i.e. only one patient dies at a particular time), and `\(i\)`-th observation is uncensored

  - Thus, observation `\(y_{i}\)` is the failure time
  
- Hazard function for `\(i\)`-th observation at time `\(y_{i}\)` is `\(h(y_{i}|x_{i}) = h_{0}(y_{i}) \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij}\beta_{j}\right)\)`

- Total hazard at time `\(y_{i}\)` for the *at risk* observations is

`$$\sum_{i': y_{i'} \geq y_{i}} h_{0}(y_{i})\exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i'j}\beta_{j}\right)$$`
---


## Partial likelihood (cont.)

- Thus, probability that the `\(i\)`-th observation is the one to fail at time `\(y_{i}\)` is

`$$\frac{h_{0}(y_{i}) \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij}\beta_{j}\right)}{\sum_{i': y_{i'} \geq y_{i}} h_{0}(y_{i})\exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i'j}\beta_{j}\right)} = \frac{ \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{ij}\beta_{j}\right)}{\sum_{i': y_{i'} \geq y_{i}} \exp\left(\sum_{j=1}^{p} x_{i'j}\beta_{j}\right)}$$`



- The baseline function is cancelled out!

--

- Partial likelihood (PL): product of these probabilities over all the uncensored observations

  - Use PL to estimate the `\(\beta_{j}\)`'s, as it is valid regardless of true `\(h_{0}(t)\)`!
  
---

## Illustration

---

## Proportional Hazards (details)

- There is no intercept `\(\beta_{0}\)`

- This presentation assumed that there are no ties in failure times (i.e. each `\(y_{i}\)` for uncensored `\(i\)` is unique)

- The baseline `\(h_{0}(t)\)` can be estimated, but is beyond the scope here

- Estimated hazard for a male patient is `\(e^{0.184}\)` = 1.202 times greater than for a female patient

  - Holding other features fixed, males have a 1.2 times greater chance of dying than females, at any point in time. But not significant
  
--

- Each one-unit increase in the Karnofsky index corresponds to a multiplier of `\(e^{-0.055}\)` = 0.946 in the instantaneous chance of dying

  - The higher the Karnofsky index, the lower the chance of dying at any given point in time

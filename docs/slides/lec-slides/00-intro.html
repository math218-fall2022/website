## What is Data Science?

*"Data science is a concept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods in order to understand and analyze actual phenomena with data. It employs techniques and theories drawn from many fields within the context of &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;mathematics, statistics, information science, and computer science&lt;/font&gt;."*

.pull-right[
[-Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_science)
]

We will be leveraging the programming language R to introduce ourselves to data science.
---


## Necessary background

We assume ZERO background in data science, statistics, and coding. We will help you get started with learning statistics, but this course will *not* be your typical intro stats course.

There is a large emphasis on computing, so all we need is an openness to learn! (and a laptop)

That being said, there is a lot of material in this course!

## Your Turn!

---

## Create a GitHub account

&lt;small&gt;

&lt;small&gt;

.instructions[
Go to https://github.com/, and create an account (unless you already have one). After you create your account, click [here](https://forms.gle/CzeyScmzudMTbMTQ6) and enter your GitHub username.
]

Tips for creating a username from [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice).

- Incorporate your actual name!
- Reuse your username from other contexts if you can, e.g., Twitter or Slack.
- Pick a username you will be comfortable revealing to your future boss.
- Shorter is better than longer.
- Be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible.
- Make it timeless. Don’t highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
- Avoid words laden with special meaning in programming, like `NA`.

&lt;/small&gt;

Raise your hand if you have any questions.

## Time for an analysis!

- Let's take a look at the [UN Votes](https://math118-fall2022.github.io/website/appex/00-unvotes.html) analysis


---

## Discussion 

Share with the class!

1. Start by introducing yourself! Name, year, major/ academic interest, favorite hobby.

2. Consider the plot in Part 1. Describe how the voting behaviors of the five countries have changed over time.

3. Consider the plot in Part 2. 
    - On which issues have the three countries voted most similarly in recent years?  
    - On which issues have they voted most differently in recent years? 
    - Has this changed over time?

## Activities &amp; Assessments

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Homework&lt;/font&gt;: Weekly individual homework assignments combining conceptual and computational skills. *Lowest score will be dropped.*

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Application Exercises&lt;/font&gt;: Exercises usually started in class and when assigned, due by the next class. Graded based on a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 90% will result in full points for that AE; anything lower than that will be assigned points accordingly. *Lowest two scores will be dropped.*

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Data Visualization Examples&lt;/font&gt;: Share a visualization that you find interesting. Around two presentations per week.

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Exams&lt;/font&gt;: One take-home exam, scheduled for **Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2022**.

--

- &lt;font class="vocab"&gt;Final Project&lt;/font&gt;: Projects presented during the last two days of the semester on **Friday Dec. 9, 2022 and Monday, Dec. 12, 2022**. You must complete the project and present in class to pass the course.

---

## Grade Calculation

&lt;small&gt;

| Component | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Homework | 30%|
| Application Exercises | 15% |
| Midterm Exam | 20% |
| Final Project | 30% |
| Participation | 5% |

--

- If you have a cumulative numerical average of 90 - 100, you are guaranteed at least an A-, 80 - 89 at least a B-, and 70 - 79 at least a C-. The exact ranges for letter grades will be determined after Exam 2.

- You are expected to attend all lectures. Excessive absences can impact your final course grade.


&lt;/small&gt;

---

## Excused Absences

- Students who miss a class due to a scheduled varsity trip, religious holiday, or short-term illness should fill out the respective form.
     - These excused absences do not excuse you from assigned work. 
--
- If you have a personal or family emergency or chronic health condition that affects your ability to participate in class, please contact your academic dean’s office.
--

- Exam dates cannot be changed and no make-up exams will be given. 

---

## Late Work &amp;amp; Regrade Requests

- Homework assignments: 
    - After the assigned deadline, there is a 20% penalty for each day the assignment is late
    - Please communicate with me early if you will need a homework extension!
    
- Late work will not be accepted for the take-home exams or final project. 

- Regrade requests must be submitted within one week of when the assignment is returned 

---

## Academic Honesty

All work for this class should be done in accordance with the Middlebury Honor code.

Any violations will automatically result in a grade of 0 on the assignment and will be reported to [Office of Student Conduct](https://studentaffairs.duke.edu/conduct) for further action.

---

## Reusing Code

- Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must or explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.

- On individual assignments, you may discuss the assignment with one another; however, you may not directly share code or write up with other students. 

- On team assignments, you may not directly share code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved. 

---

## Where to find help

- **If you have a question during lecture, feel free to ask it!** There are likely other students with the same question, so by asking you will create a learning opportunity for everyone.

--

- **Office Hours**: A lot of questions are most effectively answered in-person, so office hours are a valuable resource. Please use them! If my scheduled office hours do not work for you, feel free to send me an e-mail!

---


### Inclusion 

In this course, we will strive to create a learning environment that is welcoming to all students. If there is any aspect of the class that is not welcoming or accessible to you, please let me know immediately. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; 

Additionally, if you are experiencing something outside of class that is affecting your performance in the course, please feel free to talk with me and/or your academic dean.

## Installing R

Please be patient! This process may be time-consuming and stressful, but it is necessary for the rest of the course!

1. Go to the [CRAN website](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/) and click on the appropriate link under "Download and Install R"

  1.1 If you are Windows, click "Install R for the first time", then "Download R-4.2.1 for Windows"
  
  1.1 If you use a Mac, check your Mac OS system (Apple icon -&gt; About this Mac -&gt; Overview -&gt; Version xxx). Then on the website, click the newest release that supports your current OS version. 
  
  For example, if I have Version 10.14.6, I will choose the "R-3.6.3.nnpkg" because is it "for OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and higher, whereas the next version is for macOS 11.
  
---

## Installing R (cont.)

&lt;ol start = 2&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A file will download (most likely to your *Downloads* folder). Run the file by clicking on it. Allow the app to make changes to your device if prompted.

&lt;li&gt; Follow the installation instructions, until you click on "Finish" to exit the installation setup. 

At this point, R should be successfully installed.

---

## Installing RStudio Desktop

1. Go to the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) website

2. Click on "Download" in the top-right corner

3. Click on "Download" under the RStudio Desktop Open Source License (Free)

4. Download RStudio Desktop recommended for your computer

  4.1 For Mac users: If you have macOS 10.15+, you can click the corresponding download button on this page. Otherwise, if you have at least macOS 10.12, click on "older version of Rstudio", find "2022.02.3" and click "Installers". Click on the link next to "MacOS" 
  
5. Run the downloaded RStudio Executable file until you hit the "Finish" button
  
---

## Opening RStudio

- For ease of access, put the RStudio shortcut onto your dock or homescreen (*Applications* folder -&gt; Drag the icon for **RStudio** to your dock or homescreen)

- To use, simply click on the RStudio icon (you do not need to click on the **R** icon)

# Welcome!

## What is statistical learning?

- Learning (well) from data

---

## Predict disease given demographic and health measurements

```{r echo = F, fig.align = "center"}
vars <- c("Age","AlcoholDay", "SmokeNow", "BMI", "BPDiaAve")
nhanes <- NHANES %>%
  dplyr::select(all_of(vars)) %>%
  na.omit() 
cols <- rep("blue", nrow(nhanes))
cols[which(nhanes$SmokeNow == "Yes")] <- "orange"
pairs(nhanes %>% dplyr::select(-SmokeNow), col = cols)

```

---

## Relationship between earnings and demographics

```{r fig.align="center", fig.width = 8, fig.height = 5, echo=FALSE}
library(ISLR)
attach(Wage) #Mid-Atlantic Wage Data
p1 <- Wage %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = age , y = wage))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()+
  theme_classic() +
  theme( text = element_text(size = 16))
p2 <- Wage %>%
  ggplot(., aes(x = education, y = wage, fill = education)) + 
  geom_boxplot()+
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank(), text = element_text(size = 16))
gridExtra::grid.arrange(p1,p2, nrow =1)
```

---

## Identify numbers 

```{r fig.align="center",out.width="70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/01-intro/mnist2.jpeg")
```

---

## Classify pixels in imagery

```{r fig.align="center",out.width="70%",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/01-intro/landsat.jpg")
```

## Categories of statistical learning problems

- Classification
- Learning relationships
- Prediction

---

## Supervised Learning

- Notation: let $i = 1,\ldots, n$ index the observation
- For each observation $i$, we have:
  - Outcome/response: $y_{i}$
  - Vector of $p$ predictors/covariates: $\mathbf{x}_{i} = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ip})'$
  
--

- **Regression**: the $y_{i}$ are quantitative (e.g. height, price)

--

- **Classification**: the $y_{i}$ are categorical/qualitative (e.g. education level, diagnosis)

--

- Goal: relate response $y_{i}$ to the various predictors


---

## Objectives in Supervised Learning

1. Explanatory: understand which predictors affect the response, and how 
2. Prediction: accurately predict unobserved cases for new measurements of predictors
3. Assessment: quantify the quality of our predictions and inference

---

## Unsupervised Learning

- We only observe the $\mathbf{x}_{i}$, but no associated response $y_{i}$
- "Unsupervised" because there is no response variable guiding the analysis!

--

- Objective may not be as clearly defined
- Difficult to assess how well your are doing

# Git and GitHub

---

## Version control

- We will be using Git and GitHub for version control

---

## Versioning

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/01-intro/lego-steps.png")
```

---

## Versioning 

with human readable messages

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/01-intro/lego-steps-commit-messages.png")
```

---

### Why do we need version control?

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/01-intro/phd_comics_vc.gif")
```

---

## Git and GitHub tips

- **Git** is a version control system -- like “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word. 

--

- **GitHub** is the home for your Git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).

--

- There are a lot of Git commands and very few people know them all. 99% of the time you will use git to add, commit, push, and pull.

---

## Git and GitHub tips

- We will be doing git things and interfacing with GitHub through RStudio
    - If you Google for help you might come across methods for doing these things in the command line -- skip that and move on to the next resource unless you feel comfortable trying it out.

--

- There is a great resource for working with git and R: [happygitwithr.com](http://happygitwithr.com/).
    - Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.

## Before next class 

- Read [Nature article](files/reproducibility_crisis.pdf) on reproducibility (also available on Canvas) for discussion on Friday

- Fill out the **Getting To Know You Survey on Canvas** - due tonight at 11:59pm

  - After filling out the survey, [schedule](https://calendly.com/beckytang/10min) a brief 1:1 meeting with me! 

- Accept the e-mailed GitHub invitation to join our course organization. If you did not receive an invitation, that means I do not have your GitHub username!

- Please create a folder on your desktop called "Math218"

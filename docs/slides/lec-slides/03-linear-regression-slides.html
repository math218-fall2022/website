## Linear regression

- A simple, widely used approach to supervised learning

- Assumes that the dependence of `\(Y\)` on the predictors `\(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{p}\)` is linear

## Linear regression for abalone data

Questions we can ask:

- Is there a relationship between the age and physical characteristics of abalone?

- How strong is the relatinships between abalone age and the physical attributes?

- Which physical attributes are associated with age? What is the strength of the association?

- How accurately can we predict abalone age?

- Is the relationship linear?

---

## Simple linear regression

- **Simple linear regression** assumes a linear model for a quantative response using a single predictor:

`$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X + \epsilon,$$`

  where `\(\beta_{0}, \beta_{1}\)` are unknown **coefficients** or **parameters** and `\(\epsilon\)` is the error term

- `\(\beta_{0}\)` is commonly referred to as the **intercept**, and `\(\beta_{1}\)` as the **slope**


--

- For example,  `\(\qquad \color{blue}{\text{age}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{length}} +\epsilon\)`


--

- We use training data to obtain estimates of the coefficients, `\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)`

- Once we have stimates for the coefficients, can predict future responses at `\(X = x\)` using `$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x$$`

---

## Estimation of parameters by least squares

- In practice, `\(\beta_{0}\)` and `\(\beta_{1}\)` are unknown, so we must estimate them!

- Assuming `\(n\)` observations, we have data of the form `\((x_{1}, y_{1}), (x_{2}, y_{2}), \ldots, (x_{n}, y_{n})\)`

- Goal: obtain estimates `\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)` such that `\(y_{i} \approx \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i}\)`

- To measure how close a resulting line is to the `\(n\)` data points, we will minimize the *least squares* criterion

--

- Let `\(\hat{y}_{i} =  \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{i}\)` be prediction for `\(Y\)` based on `\(i\)`-th value of `\(X\)`

- Then `\(i\)`-th **residual** is: `\(e_{i} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}\)`

---

## Estimation of parameters by least squares

- Define **residual sum of squares** (RSS) as `$$RSS = e_{1}^{2} + e_{2}^{2} + \ldots + e_{n}^{2}$$`

- This is equivalent to `$$RSS = (y_{1} - \hat{\beta}_{0}  - \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{1})^2 + (y_{2} - \hat{\beta}_{0}  - \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{2})^2 + \ldots (y_{n} - \hat{\beta}_{0}  - \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{n})^2$$` 

--

- Least square approach selects the pair `\((\hat{\beta}_{0}, \hat{\beta}_{1})\)` that minimize the RSS. Can be shown that the minimizing values are:

`\begin{align*}
\hat{\beta}_{1} &amp;= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - \bar{x})(y_{i} - \bar{y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}\\
\hat{\beta}_{0} &amp;= \bar{y} - \hat{\beta}_{1} \bar{x}
\end{align*}`

where `\(\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\)` and `\(\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\)`

---

## Abalone example

Least squares fit for regression of `\(\color{blue}{\text{age}}\)` on `\(\color{blue}{\text{length}}\)`, with selected residuals.

---

### Assessing Accuracy of Coefficient Estimates

`$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X + \epsilon$$`

- `\(\beta_{0}\)` is the expected value of `\(Y\)` when `\(X = 0\)`

- `\(\beta_{1}\)` is the average increase in `\(Y\)` for one-unit increase in `\(X\)`

- `\(\epsilon\)` is error

- This equation is the *population regression line*

--

- When using the least squares estimates for the coefficients, `\(\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1} X\)` is the *least squares line*

- Note: the estimates of `\(\beta_{0}\)` and `\(\beta_{1}\)` will depend on the observed data!

---

### Assessing Accuracy of Coefficient Estimates

- Simulated example: true model is `\(Y = 1 + 3X + \epsilon\)`, where `\(\epsilon\)` is error from mean-zero normal distribution

- We will generate `\(n = 100\)` data points from this model and fit the least squares line to these data

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- We can continue to simulate datasets of `\(n=100\)` observations. Below are the least squares lines for each separate set of simulated data.

---

### Assessing Accuracy of Coefficient Estimates


&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

### Assessing Accuracy of Coefficient Estimates

- Estimates `\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)` on the basis of a particular data set will not exactly equal the true parameters

- But averaging estimates over a large number of data sets would lead to perfect estimation

- Then, how accurate are our estimates `\(\hat{\beta}_{0}\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)`?

--

- *Standard error* (SE) of an estimator reflects how it varies under repeated sampling. For simple linear regression:

`$$\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{0}) = \sigma^2 \left[ \frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{x}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}\right], \qquad \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1}) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}$$`

where `\(\sigma^2 = \text{Var}(\epsilon)\)`

---

### Assessing Accuracy of Coefficient Estimates

- Typically `\(\sigma^2\)` is not known, but can be estimated from the data. Estimate `\(\hat{\sigma}\)` is residual standard error (RSE) given by:

`$$\hat{\sigma}= \text{RSE} = \sqrt{\text{RSS}/(n-2)}$$`

- We use this estimate to calculate `\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{0})\)` and `\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1})\)`

--

- Standard errors can be used to compute **confidence intervals** for the coefficients! A 95% confidence interval (CI) is the range of values such that with 95% probability, the range will contain the true value of the parameter.

---

## Confidence Intervals

- For linear regression, the 95% CI for `\(\beta_{1}\)` is approximately 
`$$\hat{\beta}_{1} \pm 2 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1})$$`
- So, there is approximately a 95% chance that the true value of `\(\beta_{1}\)` falls between `\(\hat{\beta}_{1} - 2 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1})\)` and `\(\hat{\beta}_{1} + 2 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1})\)`.

- Similarly, the 95% CI for the intercept is 
`$$\hat{\beta}_{0} \pm 2 \cdot \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{0})$$`

--


- In the abalone example, the 95% CI for `\(\beta_{0}\)` is (3.23, 3.96), and the 95% CI for `\(\beta_{1}\)` is (0.07, 0.08).

---

## Hypothesis Testing

- **Hypothesis testing** is a method of statistical inference to determine whether the data at hand sufficiently support a particular hypothesis

  - Helps test the results of an experiment or survey to see if you have meaningful results
  
  - Helps draw conclusions about a population parameter
  
- Standard errors can be used to perform hypothesis tests on the coefficients

--

- **Null hypothesis** `\(H_{0}\)`: there is no relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` versus

- **Alternative hypothesis** `\(H_{A}\)`: there is some relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`

--

- Mathematically, corresponds to testing `$$H_{0}: \beta_{1} = 0 \quad \text{ vs. } \quad H_{A}: \beta_{1} \neq 0$$`

because if `\(H_{0}\)` true, then the model would reduce to `\(Y = \beta_{0} + \epsilon\)`

---

## Hypothesis Testing

- To test this null hypothesis, want to determine if `\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)` is sufficiently far from zero 

  - How much is 'sufficiently far'? Depends on `\(\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1})\)`
  
- Compute **t-statistic**: `$$t = \frac{\hat{\beta}_{1} - 0}{\text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_{1})}$$`

--

- Follows a `\(t\)`-distribution with `\(n-2\)` degrees of freedom, assuming `\(\beta_{1} = 0\)`

--

- `\(t\)` is very large (positive or negative) when `\(\hat{\beta}_{1}\)` is very far from 0 and standard error is not too large

- Can calculate **p-value**, which is the probability of observaing any value equal to `\(|t|\)` or larger

---

## Hypothesis testing


```
## # A tibble: 2 Ã— 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)   3.60     0.186        19.3 1.61e-79
## 2 length        0.0747   0.00173      43.1 0
```

--

- For abalone example, `\(t =\)` 43.08 with a p-value essentially equal to 0

- Compare `\(p\)`-value to a pre-determine rejection level `\(\alpha\)` (often `\(\alpha = 0.05\)`). If `\(p\)`-value `\(&lt; \alpha\)`, reject `\(H_{0}\)`

---

## Assessing Model Accuracy

- How well does the model fit the data?

- **Residual standard error** (RSE) `$$\text{RSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-2}\text{RSS}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^2}$$`

  - Recall that `\(RSE\)` is estimate of the standard deviation of `\(\epsilon\)`
  
--
  
  - Considered a measure of the *lack of fit* of the model
  
  - Measured in the units of `\(Y\)`
  
--

- **R-squared** `\((R^2)\)` is the proportion of variance in `\(Y\)` explained by `\(X\)`:
`$$R^2 = \frac{\text{TSS} - \text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}} = 1 - \frac{\text{RSS}}{\text{TSS}},$$` where `\(\text{TSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \bar{y})^2\)` is the *total sum of squares*

--

  - It can be shown that in the case of simple linear regression, `\(R^2 = \rho^2\)`, where `\(\rho\)` is correlation between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)`
  


---

## Assessing Model Accuracy



- For the RSE from regressing age on length is 2.692, and the `\(R^2\)` is 0.308


---

# Multiple Linear Regression

---

## Multiple Linear Regression

- In practice, we often have more than one predictor.

- With `\(p\)` predcitors, the model is `$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \ldots + \beta_{p}X_{p}$$`

--

- For abalone example, the model is `$$\color{blue}{\text{age}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}} + \beta_{2}\color{blue}{\text{length}} + \beta_{3}\color{blue}{\text{weight}} + \epsilon$$`

--

- Interpret `\(\beta_{j}\)` as the *average* effect on `\(Y\)` for a one-unit increase in `\(X_{j}\)`, **holding all other predictors** fixed/constant

---

## Multiple Linear Regression

- Given estimates `\(\hat{\beta}_{0}, \hat{\beta}_{1}, \ldots, \hat{\beta}_{p}\)`, can make predictions `$$\hat{y} = \hat{\beta}_{0} + \hat{\beta}_{1}x_{1} +\hat{\beta}_{2}x_{2} + \ldots + \hat{\beta}_{p}x_{p}$$`

- Once again, estimate the coefficients as the values that minimize the sum of squared residuals `$$RSS = \sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i})^2$$`


---

## Interpreting regression coefficients

- The ideal scenario is when the predictors are uncorrelated

- Correlations amongst predictors cause problems

  - Difficulty in interpretation -- when one predictor changes, the other correlated predictors will also change
  
--

- Fitting coefficients for abalone data:


```
## # A tibble: 4 Ã— 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt;
## 1 (Intercept)  4.34      0.315       13.8    0    
## 2 height       0.114     0.00897     12.7    0    
## 3 length       0.0341    0.00472      7.22   0    
## 4 weight       0.00209   0.00113      1.85   0.065
```

--

- Correlations for abalone data:


```
##          age height length weight
## age    1.000  0.555  0.555  0.538
## height 0.555  1.000  0.828  0.819
## length 0.555  0.828  1.000  0.925
## weight 0.538  0.819  0.925  1.000
```

---

## Questions

1. Is at least one of the predictors useful in explaining the response? 

--

2. Do all the predictors help to expalin `\(Y\)`, or is only a subset useful?

--

3. How well does the model fit the data?

--

4. Given a set of predictors `\(X =x\)`, what is the predicted response? How accurate is our prediction?

---

## 1. Is at least one predictor useful?

- Can extend the hypothesis test from simple linear regression to the multiple predictors setting:

`$$H_{0}: \beta_{1} = \beta_{2} = \ldots = \beta_{p} = 0$$` versus

`$$H_{A}: \text{ at least one } \beta_{j} \text{ is non-zero}$$`

--

- Test this hypothesis using the `\(F\)`-statistic: `$$F = \frac{(\text{TSS}-\text{RSS})/p}{\text{RSS}/(n-p-1)} \sim F_{p.n-p-1}$$`

  - If `\(H_{0}\)` true, we expect `\(F\)` close to 1. Otherwise, we expect `\(F\)` to be much larger than 1
  
- If we reject `\(H_{0}\)` and conclude that at least one of the predictors is related to `\(Y\)`, we will naturally ask which one(s)?
  
--



- For abalone data, the `\(F\)` statistic for this hypothesis is 708.53

---

## 2. Deciding on important predictors

- Task of determining subset of important predictors from full set of available predictors is known as *variable selection*

- Ideally, we would want to compare different models, each containing one of the possible subsets of predictors.

- However, we often cannot examine all possible models

  - With `\(p\)` predictors, there are `\(2^p\)` possible models! 
  
- Rather than consider each one, it is common to use an automated and efficient approach

---

## Forward selection

1. Begin with *null model*, the model that contains an intercept but zero predictors

--

2. Fit `\(p\)` simple linear regression models (one for each predictors). Add to the null model the variable that results in lowest RSS

--

3. Fit `\(p-1\)` two-variable models, all of which contain an intercept and the predictor selected from step 2. Add to the model that variable that results in lowest RSS

--

Continue until some stopping rule is satisfied

---

## Backward selection

1. Begin with *full model*, the model that contains all variables

--

2. Remove from the full model the variable with the largest `\(p\)`-value

--

3. Fit the new model, and remove the variable with the largest `\(p\)`-value

--

Continue until some stopping rule is satsfied

---

## 3. Assessing model fit

- Can generalize the RSE and `\(R^2\)` from simple linear regression setting to multiple linear regression

`$$\text{RSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-p-1} \text{RSS}}$$`

- Note that `\(R^2\)` will *always* increase when new predictors are added to the model
  
  - More predictors always results in decreasing `\(\text{RSS}\)`
  
- Therefore, when comparing models with more than one predictor, we use **adjusted** `\(R^2\)`

---

## 4. Predictions

---

# Other considerations in regression

---

## Qualitative predictors

- Thus far, we have assumed that all predictors in linear model are quantitative. In practice, we often have qualitative/categorical predictors

- Our abalone data has the `\(\color{blue}{\text{sex}}\)` of each observation: Male, Female, and Infant

--

- Let's begin with the simplest case: predictor with two categories

---

## Qualitative predictors

- If a qualitative predictors only has two *levels* (possible values), it is very simple to incorporate!

- Create an *indicator* or dummy variable 

- We will first consider the subset of the abalone data where `\(\color{blue}{\text{sex}}\)` is either Male or Female



- Based on the `\(\color{blue}{\text{sex}}\)` variable, create a new variable as follows:

`$$x_{i} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Male} \\
0 &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Female} \end{cases}$$`
--

- Use this new dummy variable as a predictor

---

## Qualitative predictors: Abalone data

- For example, a simple linear regression model for `\(\color{blue}{\text{age}}\)` would be

`$$y_{i} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x_{i} + \epsilon_{i} = \begin{cases} \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} + \epsilon_{i} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Male} \\
\beta_{0} + \epsilon_{i} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Female} \end{cases}$$`

--

- How to interpet?

--

Results for model fit on subsetted data:


```
## # A tibble: 2 Ã— 5
##   term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value
##   &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;     &lt;dbl&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;

## 2 sexM          -0.417    0.116      -3.60 0.000321
```


---

## Qualitative predictors: Abalone data

- Fitted model is: `$$\hat{\color{blue}{\text{age}_{i}}} = 12.619 + -0.417 \color{blue}{\text{Male}_{i}}$$`

  - Notice notation: `\(\color{blue}{\text{Male}_{i}}\)` is shorthand for `\(\color{blue}{\mathbf{1}(\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Male})}\)`
  
&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Qualitative predictors

- With more than two levels, we simply create additional dummy variables

- Returning to full set of abalone data where `\(\color{blue}{\text{sex}}\)` has three levels (Male, Female, or Infant), we create two dummy variables:

--

`$$x_{i1} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Male} \\
0 &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{not Male} \end{cases}$$`

--

`$$x_{i2} = \begin{cases} 1 &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Female} \\
0 &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{not Female} \end{cases}$$`

--

Results in the regression model: 
`\begin{align*}
y_{i} &amp;= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} x_{i1} + \beta_{2} x_{i2} + \epsilon_{i}\\
&amp;= \begin{cases}  \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Male} \\
\beta_{0} + \beta_{2} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Female} \\
\beta_{0} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i}} = \text{Infant} \end{cases}
\end{align*}`

---

## Qualitative predictors

- There will always be one fewer dummy variables than levels

  - Level with no dummy variable is known as *baseline*
  
  - Does the coding scheme matter?

```

---

## Extensions of linear model

- Linear model is widely used and works quite well, but has several highly restrictive assumptions

  - Relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` is additive
  - Relationship between `\(X\)` and `\(Y\)` is linear
  
- There are common approaches to loosen these assumptions

---

## Interactions

- Additive assumption: the association between a predictor `\(X_{j}\)` and the repsonse `\(Y\)` does not depend on the value of any other predictors

`$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \epsilon$$`

versus 

`$$Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1} X_{1} + \beta_{2} X_{2} + \beta_{3}\color{orange}{X_{1}X_{2}} + \epsilon$$`

--

- This third predictor `\(\color{X_{1}X_{2}}\)` is known as an **interaction** term or effect

- The total effect of `\(X_{1}\)` on `\(Y\)` also depends on the value of `\(X_{2}\)` through the interaction

---

## Interactions -- Abalone data

Model: 
`$$\color{blue}{\text{age}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}} + \beta_{2}\color{blue}{\text{length}} + \beta_{3} \color{blue}{\text{height}}\times \color{blue}{\text{length}} + \epsilon$$`

Results:

```

--

Interpretations:

  - Results suggest that the interaction is important
  
  - However, adjusted `\(R^2\)` for model with interaction is 0.339 compared to 0.339 from model without interaction

- Estimates suggest that a 1 mm increase in the \color{blue}{\text{height}} of an abalone is associated with an increased age of 0.197 + -0.001 `\(\times \color{blue}{\text{length}}\)` years

- A 1 mm increase in the \color{blue}{\text{length}} of an abalone is associated with an increased age of 0.059 + -0.001 `\(\times \color{blue}{\text{height}}\)` years

---

## Interactions 

- Can also have interactions involving categorical variables! 

- In particular, interaction between a quantitative and a categorical variable has nice interpretation

--

- Consider again subset of abalone data where we remove the observations `\(\color{blue}{\text{sex}} = \text{Infant}\)`. Consider the effects of `\(\color{blue}{\text{height}}\)` and  `\(\color{blue}{\text{sex}}\)` on `\(\color{blue}{\text{age}}\)`.

- Model with no interactions:

`$$\color{blue}{\text{age}_{i}} \approx \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} + \beta_{2} \color{blue}{\mathbf{1}(\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Male})}$$`

- Can be re-written as

`$$\color{blue}{\text{age}_{i}} \approx \begin{cases}
\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Female}} \\
(\beta_{0} + \beta_{2}) + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Male}} 
\end{cases}$$`



---

## Interactions 

- With interactions, the model takes the form:

`$$\color{blue}{\text{age}_{i}} \approx \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} + \beta_{2} \color{blue}{\mathbf{1}(\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Male})} + \beta_{3}\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} \times \color{blue}{\mathbf{1}(\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Male})}$$`

- Can be re-written as

`$$\color{blue}{\text{age}_{i}} \approx \begin{cases}
\beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Female}} \\
(\beta_{0} + \beta_{2}) + (\beta_{1} + \beta_{3})\color{blue}{\text{height}_{i}} &amp; \text{ if } \color{blue}{\text{sex}_{i} = \text{Male}} 
\end{cases}$$`

---

## Nonlinear Relationships

- Linear assumption: change in `\(Y\)` associated with a one-unit change in `\(X_{j}\)` is constant

- In some cases, true relationship between a predictor and response may be nonlinear 

- Consider some new data about cars:

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


---

## Nonlinear Relationships

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

- Data suggest a curved relationship between `\(\color{blue}{\text{horsepower}}\)` and `\(\color{blue}{\text{mpg}}\)`

- Can include transformed versions of the predictors

---

## Nonlinear Relationships

- Figure suggests a *quadratic* shape, which can be accomodated in the following model:

`$$\color{blue}{\text{mpg}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{horsepower}} + \beta_{2}\color{blue}{\text{horsepower}}^2+ \epsilon$$`

```

--

- Approach of including polynomials of predictors is known as **polynomial regression**

--

- Note: Non-linear in `\(\color{blue}{\text{horsepower}}\)`, but still linear model for `\(\color{blue}{\text{mpg}}\)`

---

## Model checking for linear regression

- Can always fit a linear regression model for quantiative `\(Y\)`, but should assess whether the linear model is appropriate

--

- Check if our assumptions are met:

  1. Linearity between predictors and response
  2. Error terms are uncorrelated
  3. Error terms have constant variance
  
--

- Additionally, check for potential problems that may influene model fit:

  1. Outliers
  2. High-leverage points
  3. Collinearity in predictors
  
---

## 1. Assumption: linearity

- *Residual plots* are useful for diagnosing non-linearity
  
  - For simple linear regression, plot the residuals `\(e_{i} = y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}\)` versus a predictor `\(x_{i}\)`
  - For multiple linear regression, plot residuals `\(e_{i}\)` versus fitted `\(\hat{y}_{i}\)`
  
&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## 2. Assumption: uncorrelated errors

- Important assumption in linear regression is that errors `\(\epsilon_{1}, \epsilon_{2}, \ldots, \epsilon_{n}\)` are uncorrelated

  - Often occur in time-series data

- Often assessed by identifiying *tracking* in the data. Plot residuals in the order they appear in the data

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-23-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## 3. Assumption: constant variance

- Assumption: `\(Var(\epsilon_{i}) = \sigma^2\)` for all observations `\(i\)`

- **Heteroscedasticity** is when the variances are non-constant

  - Funnel-shapes in residual plots help diagnosis heteroscedasticity

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-24-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## 1. Problem: outliers

- **Outliers** are points for which the true `\(y_{i}\)` is very far from the estimated/fitted `\(\hat{y}_{i}\)`

  - i.e. response `\(y_{i}\)` is unusual given corresponding `\(x_{i}\)`


&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Blue line fit to all data points, purple line fit to data removing outlier

---

## 1. Problem: outliers

- May not have too large an impact on estimated regression line, but can impact overall accuracy of model

- Residual standard error `\((\hat{\sigma})\)`:
  - Model fit on all data: 1.113
  - Model fit after removing outlier: 1
  
- `\(R^2\)`:
  - Model fit on all data: 0.164
  - Model fit after removing outlier: 0.213

---

## 2. Problem: high leverage points

- **High leverage** points have an unusual value for `\(x_{i}\)`

- Same data as previous slide + one additional point in orange

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-26-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Blue line is fit to all data
- Purple point is outlier from before. Purple line is fitted line omitting this point
- Orange line is fitted line omitting the orange point


---

## 2. Problem: high leverage points

- High leverage observations tend to have a non-negligable impact on estimated regression line

- Calculate *leverage statistic* `\((h_{i})\)` of a point. For simple linear regression:

`$$h_{i} = \frac{1}{n} + \frac{(x_{i} - \bar{x})^2}{\sum_{i'=1}^{n}(x_{i'} - \bar{x})^2}$$`

--

  - `\(h_{i}\)` is always between `\(1/n\)` and `\(1\)`
  - Average leverage for all observations is `\((p+1)/n\)`
  
--

- In simulated data:
  - Average leverage: `\((1+1)/51 =\)` 0.039
  - Leverage of purple point: 0.021
  - Leverage of orange point: 0.294
  
---

## Problem: collinearity

- As mentioned before, **collinearity** occurs when two or more predictors are closely related to one another

&lt;img src="03-linear-regression-slides_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Can be hard to separate the individual effects of `\(\color{blue}{\text{weight}}\)` and `\(\color{blue}{\text{length}}\)` on `\(\color{blue}{\text{age}}\)`

  - Reduces accuracy of the associated regression coefficients, causing the `\(SE\)` to grow
  
---

## Problem: collinearity

Model `$$\color{blue}{\text{age}} = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}\color{blue}{\text{length}} + \epsilon$$`

## Git and GitHub

We will be working with Git and GitHub as our version control system.

### Concepts introduced:
 
- Clone a GitHub repo and make a new RStudio project 
- Configure Git
- Working with a local and remote repository
- Making a change locally, committing, and pushing
- Making a change on GitHub and pulling

### Getting started

- Go to the course GitHub organization: https://github.com/math218-fall2022. 

- If you see a pending invite at the top of the page, accept the invite to join the course invite.

#### Creating personal access token 

- On the top-right corner with, click on the drop down arrow next to the graphic and then click on "Settings"

  - On the left-hand side, find and click on "< > Developer settings" (should be on bottom)
  
  - Click "Personal access tokens"
  
  - Click "Generate new token". Under "Expiration", choose Custom and then select date 12/31/2023. Then scroll down and click "Generate token"
  
  - You will see a green bar with text that starts as "ghp_pA....". *Copy* this token and paste it somewhere safe.
  

#### For first time only: Clone a GitHub repo  

- Go to the [course organization](https://github.com/math218-fall2022) on GitHub  and find the repo with the prefix **getting-started-**. 

- Click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

```{r clone-repo-link, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/00-git/clone_repo.png")
```

- Open up RStudio

- Go to the "Terminal" tab

- Type the following: git clone *copied URL*  (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/...`)

  - When prompted to enter your username: type in your GitHub username
  
  - When prompted to enter you password: **paste in your personal access token**

- Your new project should now be created! Note, we only go through this workflow once to tell GitHub that it should communicate with RStudio


#### For future projects: Clone a GitHub repo and make a new RStudio project 

- Go to the [course organization](https://github.com/math218-fall2022) on GitHub  and find the repo with the prefix **lab-01-review-**. 

- Click on the green **Clone or download** button, select **Use HTTPS** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with HTTPS** as in the image below). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

```{r clone-repo-link2, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 5}
knitr::include_graphics("img/00-git/clone_repo.png")
```

- Open up RStudio

- Go to *File* $\rightarrow$ *New Project* $\rightarrow$ *Version Control* $\rightarrow$ *Git*. 

```{r paste-gh-repo-url, echo = FALSE,  out.width = "80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/00-git/clone_git.png")
```

- Copy and paste the URL of your assignment repo into the dialog box *Repository URL*. You can leave *Project Directory Name* empty. It will default to the name of the GitHub repo. In *Create project as a subdirectory of*, hit "Browse" and find your Math218 folder.

- Click *Create Project*, and the files from your GitHub repo will be displayed the *Files* pane in RStudio. 


#### Making a change locally, committing, and pushing

- Open the RMarkdown file **lab-01-review.Rmd**. We will use that for the next part of class. 

- Put your name for the author, then knit the document. 

- Select/check **all** of the updated files in the Git pane, click the "Commit" button, and write the commit message "Updated author name". 

- Click to **push** your changes (you may have to enter your GitHub password).

- If you refresh your repo on GitHub, you will see the updated files with your commit message. 

#### Making a change on GitHub and pulling

- On the corresponding repository in GitHub, find the README.md file at the bottom. Edit this file by clicking on the pencil and typing your name + major + year. 

- Once you're finished editing, hit the green "Commit changes" button.

- Back in RStudio, navigate to the Git tab and **pull** the changes by hitting the down arrow. A small window should pop up with some text.

- Find and open the README.md file in the Files pane. You should see your changes here locally!

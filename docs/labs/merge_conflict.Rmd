<font color = "blue">**Step 0**</font>: **Everyone**: Come up with a team name.

<font color = "blue">**Step 1**</font>: **Everyone**: Clone your project repo in from the course GitHub website 
and open the R Markdown file called `project-proposal.Rmd`. 


<br>

<font color = "blue">**Step 2**</font>: Assign the numbers 1 and 2 to each of the team members. If applicable, assign the number 3 to the third member.


<font color = "blue">**Step 3**</font>: Take turns in completing the steps below exactly as written, only <u>**one member**</u> at a time:

- **<i>Member 1</i>**: Change the team name to something *different* from your team name. Knit, commit, and push.

- **<i>Member 2</i>**: Change the team name to your team name. Knit, commit, push. You will get an error. 

  - Pull and review the document with the merge conflict. Show the error to your partner.
  - A merge conflict occurred because you edited the same part of the document as Member 1. Resolve the conflict with whichever name you want to keep. 
  - Knit, commit and push.

- **<i>Member 1 (or Member 3, if team of three)</i>**: Change the date to the date the proposal is due (11/13/2022).

  - Knit, commit, push. You will get an error, read it, and pull.  Show the error to your partner.
  - No merge conflicts should occur, since you edited a different part of the document from Member 2.
  - Knit, commit, and push. 


<font color = "blue">**Step 4**</font>: **<i>All members</i>:** Pull, and observe the changes in your document.
